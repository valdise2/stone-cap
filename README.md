This repository houses the data for a concussion-based research project.
The goal of the project is to determine whether adolscents with a history
of concussions will exhibit higher levels of depressive symptoms
(headaches, dizziness, sadness, etc.) compared to inviduals with no
concussion history. 
The project utilizes a data set containing data for Canadian adolescents 
(ages 13 - 18) who are involed in sports. Participants provided
medical history as well as post concussion symptom data. 
The project will use categorical analysis techniques, as well as
machine learning models, to address adolescent concussions.
